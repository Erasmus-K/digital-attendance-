     Digital Class Attendance Application (CLI + ORM)

Developer: Erasmus Kipkosgei

A Python Phase 3 Project | SQLAlchemy ORM | Pipenv | CLI Menu System

     Project Overview

The Digital Class Attendance Application is a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) system designed for registering students, managing course assignments, recording attendance, and generating reports.

This project adheres to Phase 3 requirements:

✔ A real-world problem solved with a CLI
✔ SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables
✔ Well-maintained Pipenv virtual environment
✔ Clean, modular package structure
✔ Use of lists, dicts, tuples
✔ Best practices in Python project organization

The system is simple enough for beginners but structured professionally for scalability.

 Learning Goals (Phase 3 Requirements)

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

1. CLI Application Development

Menu-driven user interaction

Input validation

Clear separation of logic and interface

2. SQLAlchemy ORM

Creating declarative models

3+ related tables (Students, Courses, Attendance)

Foreign key relationships

Sessions & CRUD operations

3. Pipenv Environment Management

Creating isolated environments

Installing dependencies with Pipenv

Consistent dependency management

4. Python Package Structure

Organized modules under models/, services/, cli/, and config/

Separation of concerns

Readability and maintainability

5. Python Data Structures

Lists for record display

Dictionaries for mapping

Tuples returned from CRUD operations

This structure ensures clean, scalable, and testable code.

    Installation & Setup
✔ 1. Install Python 3.8+
✔ 2. Create a Pipenv Environment

Inside your project folder:

pipenv --python 3.10

✔ 3. Install Dependencies
pipenv install sqlalchemy tabulate

✔ 4. Activate Environment
pipenv shell

     Database Setup

The database file attendance.db is created automatically using SQLAlchemy when you run:

python app.py


The tables:

1. students
Field	Type	Description
id	Integer (PK)	Unique student ID
admission_no	String	Unique admission number
full_name	String	Full student name
course_id	Integer (FK)	Course assigned
2. courses
Field	Type
id	Integer (PK)
name	String (unique)
3. attendance
Field	Type
id	Integer (PK)
date	String (YYYY-MM-DD)
status	“Present” / “Absent”
student_id	FK -> students.id
     How to Run the Application
python app.py


After starting, you will see a menu like:

=== Digital Attendance System ===
1. Register student
2. Record attendance
3. View report
0. Exit

     Features / How It Works
     1. Register Students

Assign admission number

Assign full name

Assign a course ID

Saved into the database

    2. Record Attendance

Choose student by admission number

Provide date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Mark Present/Absent

    3. Generate Reports

Student attendance summary

Date-based attendance list

Total Present vs Absent

    4. Search & List

View all students

Search by name/course/admission number

    Example Reports
Student Attendance Report
Report for John Doe (ADM001)
--------------------------------------------------
2025-01-12 : Present
2025-01-13 : Absent
--------------------------------------------------
Total: 2 | Present: 1 | Absent: 1

Date Attendance Report
